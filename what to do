we have two people using the system ie administrators and users(teachers)

users enter class and leave
admins can
    see which teacher is in which class
    print reports daily, weekly and monthly to see teachers performance
    add add teachers , subjects and classes through the django admin view

when a teacher is entering in class we ask for his staff id, class stream and subject to teach
